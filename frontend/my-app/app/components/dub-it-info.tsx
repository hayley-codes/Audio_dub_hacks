        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-lg">
          <li><strong>The first integrated solution</strong> for streaming giants. AI video dubbing exists, but not yet on the enterprise level as we are aiming for.</li>

          <li>Trained with data from the <strong>integrated platform</strong>; if we partner with Netflix, DubIT will use actors from Netflix's database of films and TV shows, <strong>decreasing costs</strong>.</li>
